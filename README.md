The Personal Space Weather Station project is part of the Distributed Array of Small Instruments (DASI), which is designed to address the increasing need for high spatial and temporal resolution measurements to determine the local, regional, and global-scale processes that are essential for addressing fundamental questions in solar and space physics. This project is led by the University of Scranton, in collaboration with the Tucson Amateur Packet Radio, Inc. (TAPR), Case Western Reserve University / Case Amateur Radio Club W8EDU, the University of Alabama, the New Jersey Institute of Technology Center for Solar Terrestrial Research (NJIT-CSTR), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Haystack Observatory.
